## Architecture

This application demonstrates modern full-stack development patterns using Remix framework capabilities:

### Routing Architecture
- **Nested routing system** with layout preservation
- **Modal overlays** that maintain parent route context
- **URL-based state management** for shareable application states

### Data Flow Patterns
- **Server-side data fetching** with Remix loaders
- **Progressive form enhancement** with action handlers
- **Optimistic UI updates** for improved user experience
- **Type-safe data handling** throughout the application stack

### Code Organization
```
app/
├── routes/                 # Route-based file organization
│   ├── _index.tsx         # Application entry point
│   ├── tasks.tsx          # Main task management layout
│   ├── tasks.$taskId.tsx  # Individual task management
│   ├── tasks.new.tsx      # Task creation interface
│   └── api.*.tsx          # API endpoints
├── components/            # Reusable UI components
├── db.server.ts          # Database layer and business logic
└── root.tsx              # Application root with error boundaries
```

### Key Technical Implementations

**Server-Side Rendering**
```typescript
export async function loader({ request }: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
  const tasks = getAllTasks();
  const userStats = getUserStats();
  const achievements = getAchievements();
  return json({ tasks, userStats, achievements });
}
```

**Progressive Enhancement**
```typescript
export async function action({ request }: ActionFunctionArgs) {
  const formData = await request.formData();
  const task = createTask(formData);
  return redirect(`/tasks/${task.id}`);
}
```

**Client-Side Hydration**
```typescript
<ClientOnly>
  {() => <Confetti trigger={celebrate} />}
</ClientOnly>
```

## Usage

### Task Management Workflow

**Creating Tasks**
1. Access the task creation interface through the "Quick Add Task" button
2. Select from predefined templates or create custom tasks
3. Configure task properties including priority, due dates, and categories
4. Add detailed descriptions to maximize experience point rewards

**Experience Point System**
- Base completion rewards: 10 XP per task
- Priority multipliers: High (+15), Medium (+10), Low (+5)
- Timeliness bonus: +20 XP for on-time completion
- Detail bonus: +5 XP for comprehensive descriptions (50+ characters)

**Focus Sessions**
1. Select any task to access the integrated Pomodoro timer
2. Initiate 25-minute focus sessions with automatic break intervals
3. Track accumulated focus time per task
4. Receive browser notifications for session transitions

### Navigation and Organization
